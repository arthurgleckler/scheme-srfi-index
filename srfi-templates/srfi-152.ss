  "SRFI-152 -- String Library (reduced)")
 (description "Scheme has an impoverished set of string-processing utilities, which is
a problem for authors of portable code. This SRFI proposes a coherent
and comprehensive set of string-processing procedures. It is a reduced
version of SRFI 13 that has been aligned with SRFI 135, Immutable Texts.
Unlike SRFI 13, it has been made consistent with the R5RS, R6RS, and
R7RS-small string procedures.")
