 (title "SRFI-107 -- XML reader syntax")
 (description "We specify a reader extension that reads data in a superset of XML/HTML
format, and produces conventional S-expressions. We also suggest a
possible semantics interpretation of how these forms may be evaluated to
produce XML-node values, but this is non-normative.")
